# WaterFeature
 Office drip water feature

# Description
 Prior to moving to a new office building, my office had a leak in the roof which dripped into a bucket. I decided I would miss it (and wanted to play with a peristaltic pump), so I am making a water feature which drips a random amount at random intervals. The randomness may extend to random drip rate, but that may be an unnecessary upgrade.
 
# Changes
 Originally, I was going to use a 28BYJ-48 unipolar motor (which I had on hand), but have found these to have too low torque. This branch is for experimenting with a Nema 17. This will cause the lib_deps to change.
