 Office drip water feature

# Description
 Prior to moving to a new office building, my office had a leak in the roof which dripped into a bucket. I decided I would miss it (and wanted to play with a peristaltic pump), so I am making a water feature which drips a random amount at random intervals. The randomness may extend to random drip rate, but that may be an unnecessary upgrade.
